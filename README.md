# webscraping_jobs
I scraped job advertisement data from the Timesjobs website using the BeautifulSoup library for this personal project. Using BeautifulSoup, information was extracted, including the firm name, location, published date, skills needed, job descriptions, and an application link. The information was then exported to a CSV file.
